vector or array  
  
Following are the list of advantages of vector over array :  
Resizing : Vectors can dynamically resize themselves, while arrays have a fixed size.   
Memory allocation : Vectors handle memory allocation and deallocation automatically, while arrays require manual management.  

/* set the position of the object */  
void 	setPosition (float x, float y)
  
/* set the local origin of the object */  
void 	setOrigin (float x, float y)

sf::Texture stores pixels that can be drawn, with a sprite for example.
